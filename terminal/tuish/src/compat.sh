# ─── Making `local` mean local ───────────────────────────────────
# On ksh93 the alias above is a lie, and it is the expensive kind.
#
# `typeset` creates a local variable in a KSH-STYLE function — `function f { ... }` — and
# NOT in a POSIX one — `f () { ... }`. Every function in this toolkit is POSIX-style. So on
# ksh93 every `local` in tuish declares a GLOBAL, and a framework helper's scratch variable
# silently overwrites any caller variable that happens to share its name.
#
# That is not a hypothetical. draw.sh builds a box's top border into `local _top`; a host
# that keeps its layout row in `_top` (examples/cooperative.sh does) gets its row replaced
# by the string "╭────────╮" and hands it to tuish_text as a coordinate. The repo has been
# carrying this as "a pre-existing ksh rendering bug" that test_hosting.sh skips over.
#
# The cure is to make the functions ksh-style after the fact: dump each one with
# `typeset -f`, and re-define it with the `function` keyword. Same body, real locals.
#
# WHAT MUST NOT BE CONVERTED, and this is the whole subtlety: a ksh-style function gets its
# own scope for more than variables. **Traps and shell options are local to it too.** An
# EXIT trap set inside one fires when the FUNCTION returns, not when the process exits — so
# converting tuish's trap-installing path would tear the terminal down the instant init
# finished. The exclusion list below is that path, and it is load-bearing.
#
# Detection is by FEATURE, not by shell name: define a POSIX function whose only act is to
# declare a local, and see whether it escapes. Shells where `local` works answer '' and skip
# the whole thing; only a shell that actually leaks pays for the fix.
#
# Ported from the same trick in Coral (core/footer.sh).

# What must stay POSIX. Space-delimited, and every entry earns its place.
#
# 1. THE TRAP PATH. A ksh-style function owns its traps and its shell options: an EXIT trap
#    set inside one fires when the FUNCTION returns, not when the process exits. Convert
#    these and tuish tears the terminal down the instant init finishes.
#
# 2. THE REFLECTIVE FUNCTIONS. This is the subtle one, and it is the reason the conversion
#    cannot simply be applied to everything.
#
#    ksh-style functions are STATICALLY scoped: a caller's local is INVISIBLE to a function
#    it calls. But tuish's whole no-fork idiom is to pass a variable NAME and have the
#    callee dereference it (docs/str.md) — `tuish_str_width _t` — precisely so nobody has
#    to fork a subshell to get an answer back. Convert the callee and it can no longer see
#    the `_t` it was handed.
#
#    Left POSIX, they run in the CALLER's scope and can still read the name they are given —
#    even when the caller is a converted ksh function. That asymmetry is what makes the
#    whole scheme work, and it is why the skip list is a design decision, not a wart.
#
# 3. THE BLOCKING LOOP. Worse than local traps: entering a ksh-style function RESETS traps
#    to their default for that scope, so a signal arriving while ANY ksh function is on the
#    stack is not deferred — it is DISCARDED. WINCH's default is "ignore". tuish_run is
#    where the process sits blocked in `read` waiting for input, which is exactly when a
#    terminal resize arrives, so converting it means the resize is silently dropped and the
#    app never relays out. (_tuish_get_byte / _tuish_idle_wait need no entry: _tuish_init_io
#    redefines them at device init, after the fixup has already run.)
#
# ONE LINE, deliberately: the lookup is `case $skip in *" $name "*)`, so every entry has to
# be space-delimited on BOTH sides. Wrap this onto a second line and the last name on each
# line is followed by a newline instead of a space, and silently stops being skipped.
