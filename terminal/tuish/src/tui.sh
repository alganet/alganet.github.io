# src/tui.sh - Terminal UI core: setup, teardown, traps, IO stubs
# Source compat.sh and ord.sh first, then this file.  Do not execute directly.
#
# Provides:
#   tuish_init             - set up terminal for TUI (raw mode, protocol detection)
#   tuish_fini             - restore terminal to previous state
#   tuish_quit             - signal event loop to stop
#   tuish_quit_main        - quit, leave viewport content visible, cursor below
#   tuish_quit_clear       - quit, clear viewport, restore cursor position
#   tuish_update_size      - refresh TUISH_LINES / TUISH_COLUMNS
#   tuish_begin            - start output buffering
#   tuish_end              - flush buffer and stop buffering
#   tuish_flush            - flush buffer (keep buffering active)
#   tuish_show_cursor      - show cursor
#   tuish_hide_cursor      - hide cursor
#   tuish_save_cursor      - save cursor position (DECSC)
#   tuish_restore_cursor   - restore cursor position (DECRC)
#   tuish_reset_scroll     - reset scroll region to full screen
#
# Variables (set after tuish_init):
#   TUISH_LINES            - terminal height
#   TUISH_COLUMNS          - terminal width
#   TUISH_INIT_ROW         - cursor row when init was called
#   TUISH_PROTOCOL         - keyboard protocol: "vt" or "kitty"
#   TUISH_TIMING           - timeout resolution: "sub" or "second"
#   TUISH_TICK_US          - idle interval in microseconds (for time-based animation)
#
# Configuration (set before tuish_init):
#   TUISH_TABSIZE          - tab stop interval (default: 4)
#   TUISH_FINI_OFFSET      - lines below init position to place cursor after fini (default: 0)
#   TUISH_IDLE_TIMEOUT     - idle event interval in seconds (default: 0.26, or 1 for second timing)
#   TUISH_ESC_TIMEOUT      - max wait (seconds) for an escape sequence to continue
#                            (default: 0.02, or 1 for second timing). Well-formed
#                            CSI/SS3 sequences dispatch on their final byte without
#                            waiting; this only bounds a lone ESC or an Alt-<key>.

# That is fine for a child running its own loop, and wrong for a host assembling one
# frame: mounting three widgets inside a host repaint would emit three extra writes,
# and the terminal would draw each one.
#
# HOLD catches every flush, from any context, into one string. It is device-global on
# purpose: it is about the output stream, which there is only one of. tuish_ctx_mount

# things in it — the caret hide that precedes every deferred render, for one. An app
# that buffers inside its own render handler (any host does) used to reset the buffer
# and throw those away, silently: the caret stayed on, blinking wherever the last cell
# was drawn. Nesting means whoever opened the frame owns it, and nobody inside can cut
# it in half by accident.

# ─── Tracked key holds ───────────────────────────────────────────
# " <sanitized>:<µs left> <sanitized>:<µs left> ... " — the keys this context asked to
# track (tuish_key_track, in keybind.sh) and how much of each one's window is left.
#
# A plain VT reports no key release: holding a key is just the same event arriving again at
# the OS autorepeat rate. So "down" is inferred by RECENCY — each matching event refills the
# window, each idle tick drains it by TUISH_TICK_US, and anything left means the key is
# still down. Empty here is the norm, and both hot-path hooks in event.sh test this string
# first so an app that tracks nothing pays one comparison.
#
# The window lives per-context, not as one device setting, because it is a property of the
# app doing the inferring: a game wants a tight one, a hosted widget may want another. Both
# are here at the seam rather than in keybind.sh for the reason above them — event.sh reads
# them per event, and keybind.sh is optional.

# Whether mouse-tracking escapes are currently active ON THE TERMINAL. This is
# DEVICE state (the terminal is singular), so — unlike _tuish_mouse, which is a
# per-context "does THIS app want mouse events" flag — it is NOT registered as a
# context field. A child that enables mouse sets this; at final teardown, fini
# reads THIS (not the by-then-inactive child's _tuish_mouse) to know it must emit
# the mouse-off escape. Without it, a child that enabled mouse leaks tracking
# into the shell after exit (the root context's _tuish_mouse is still 0).
_tuish_mouse_dev=0

# The same argument holds for kitty's detailed mode, which was never turned off at all:
# tuish_detailed_on emits `[=11u` and nothing ever put it back, so a child that enabled it
# leaked repeat/release reports into the shell after exit.
#
# The rule both encode: an app REQUESTS device state; only the device layer restores it. An
# app that puts the terminal back is reaching outside the rectangle it owns.
_tuish_detailed_dev=0

# AUTOWRAP has no device mirror, and that is deliberate — the obvious symmetry here is a
# trap I fell into and had to back out of.
#
# _tuish_wrap is per-context, and it looks like it needs reconciling on every context
# switch: a child turns DECAWM on, the host resumes with _tuish_wrap=0, and the terminal is
# left wrapping while the host thinks it clips. But look at what the flag actually gates
# (term.sh): wrap=0 makes tuish_text TRIM the text to the columns that fit. A context with
# wrap=0 never lets a glyph reach the right edge, so what DECAWM is set to cannot affect it.
# The stale device is inert.
#
# The one real mismatch is the other direction — a context with wrap=1 (which does NOT trim,
# by definition) running while DECAWM is off, so the terminal clips where the app wanted it
# to wrap. That needs a device toggle, and tuish_wrap_on already emits one. It only goes
# stale if some OTHER context calls tuish_wrap_off in between.
#
# Reconciling that on every tuish_ctx_activate is what I tried, and it is worse than the
# disease: _tuish_write routes by _tuish_buffering, which is itself a per-context register,
# so an escape emitted mid-switch lands in whichever buffer happens to be swapped in — and
# the toolkit's one-buffer-one-write-one-frame invariant (see _tuish_sink) goes with it.
# A narrow hazard nothing in-tree can trigger is not worth breaking the frame for.
#
# So: if you write a widget that calls tuish_wrap_on, do not also expect a sibling to call
# tuish_wrap_off and leave you correct. Re-assert it in your render, the way the caret shape
# is re-asserted (term.sh).

# ─── App field sets: state that belongs to an INSTANCE ───────────
# tuish_ctx_register above is the FRAMEWORK tier: one global list, marshalled for every
# context that exists. That is right for framework state (every context has a viewport)
# and wrong for an app's, for two reasons — every context would pay to marshal the
# editor's cursor row, and worse, an app that wants to be mounted TWICE has nowhere to put
# the second instance's state.
#
# That was a real limit, not a theoretical one: examples/editor.sh kept _cur_row, _view_top
# and the rest as plain globals, so two editors in one page shared a cursor. The website
# only ever opens one at a time, which is how it got away with it.
#
# So: a second tier. An app DECLARES a named set of fields once, at source time, and
# ATTACHES it to whichever context it is running in.
#
#   tuish_ctx_declare _ed _cur_row _cur_col _view_top ...   # once, at source time
#   _ed_setup () { tuish_init; tuish_ctx_fields _ed; ... }  # per instance
#
# DECLARATION IS AT SOURCE TIME, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE TRICK. The obvious design — capture
# each field's default when it is attached — breaks on the exact case the feature exists
# for: when editor #2 attaches, the live _cur_row is editor #1's cursor row, and #2 would
# start life holding it. Declaring at source time captures the value the app itself wrote
# in its own declarations, which is what a default IS.
#
# It also means _tuish_ctx_defaults never sees these fields, so unlike the framework tier
# they cannot be wiped by a context creation that happens after registration.
#
# Storage: _tuish_ctxd_<SET> is the set's field list, _tuish_ctxf_<id> the sets attached to
# context <id>. (Not _tuish_ctx_<id>__fields — that could collide with a field genuinely
# named _fields.)
# The prefixed locals are not fussiness. This runs at SOURCE time — that is the whole point
# of it — which is before tuish_init, and therefore before compat.sh's tuish_fnfix has made
# `local` mean local. On ksh93 these two ARE globals, and `_set` and `_n` are exactly the

# rows and lengthens a line at a time). A root that took its region from its viewport would
# clip itself to nothing the moment it asked for `grow`, whose TUISH_VIEW_ROWS is 0 until
# the first line is emitted.

# it from the viewport.

# ─── Cooperative driving (non-modal hosting) ─────────────────────
# A host keeps its single tuish_run loop and DRIVES mounted children one event at
# a time, instead of each child running its own (blocking) tuish_run. When a child
# context is active the whole event pipeline already targets it — hid.sh decodes
# mouse into the child's region-local frame, tuish_dispatch uses the child's bind
# table, and the render path calls the child's handler — so driving a child is just
# "activate it, feed it the raw event, restore the host". Modal hosting (the child
# owning a nested tuish_run) still works; this is the alternative for live host
# chrome + simultaneous widgets.

# Set by tuish_ctx_dispatch to 1 when the child it just drove requested quit
# (the dispatched event ran the child's own tuish_quit / tuish_quit_clear — e.g.
# its bound 'q' or ctrl-w). Device-global, NOT a context field: it is the host's
# signal to unmount a child that ended ITSELF. This is the non-fragile
# cooperative-quit model — a driven app quits by its own means and the host
# detects it, instead of the host having to intercept the app's quit key (which a
# terminal or browser may reserve, e.g. Ctrl+W). A host checks it after each
# tuish_ctx_dispatch and calls tuish_ctx_unmount when set.

# hosting an outside click self-quits the child to hand control back, but a DRIVEN
# child's host already routes out-of-region clicks itself (it only forwards what

# redraw scheduler are per-context registers, so the child's tuish_begin/end and
# rAF render stay isolated from the host's. Requires event.sh (a cooperative host
# always sources it). No loop variable here — the zsh loop-var invariant is intact.
#
# Use this for INPUT (keys, mouse, resize). For idle, use tuish_ctx_tick, which
# honours each child's own tick rate instead of firing on every host tick.
# A host routes events from INSIDE its own event handler, which the framework already runs
# inside a frame (_tuish_parse_event's tuish_begin/tuish_end). So the host has a frame open
# the whole time we are down in the child — and _tuish_buffering, the flag that decides
# whether a write is buffered or goes straight to the terminal, is a per-context register.
# The moment we activate the child, it reads 0, and everything the child emits leaves the
# host's frame as a write of its own: the child's echoed keystroke, any device escape it
# switches on, the autowrap reconcile in tuish_ctx_activate. Two writes, sometimes more,
# where the toolkit promises one — and the escapes land ahead of chrome that was buffered
# before them.
#
# HOLD is the answer to exactly this, and tuish_ctx_render and tuish_ctx_mount already use
# it: it is device-global (there is one output stream), so it catches a flush from any
# context, at any depth. Hold across the whole dispatch and every byte the child produces
# folds into the host's frame, in order, and the repaint stays one write.

# rectangle immediately instead of waiting for its next idle tick — at a lazy interval
# that would leave a visibly stale or torn widget on screen for a whole tick while the
# user scrolls. Requires event.sh (the render-handler indirection lives there).
#
# If the HOST is buffering when it calls this, the child's output is spliced into the
# host's frame rather than written on its own. That is what makes a host repaint atomic:
# a page with four live widgets otherwise emits five separate writes, and the terminal
# draws each one — you see the prose land at the new scroll offset while the widgets are
# still at the old, a frame at a time. One buffer, one write, one frame.
#
# The child's output goes in at the point the host called from, so a host that fills its
# background first and renders its children last still gets that order.
#
# Buffering the child is not enough on its own: a child is free to tuish_flush inside its
# own render (canvas_demo does, to get its panels out before its status line), and a flush
# writes whatever has accumulated no matter how deep the frame is. So HOLD as well — then
