<h2>Hello Blog</h2>
<p class=info><em>Alexandre Gomes Gaigalas</em> – <em>May 26, 2025</em></p>

<p>For a while now, I've been wanting to start a technical blog. I decided to transform this simple, hand-crafted HTML
website into a platform for it.</p>

<p>It is as close as pure HTML as you can get. I create posts by writing the HTML by hand, and there is a 80-line (at
the time of writing) <a href=build.sh>shell script</a> that manages the content.</p>

<p>I decided not to use any form of markdown or any form of templating for the solution. However, my solution has some
nice tricks on its sleeve:</p>

<ul>
<li>If I change the index.html header, the shell script updates all the post pages for me.</li>
<li>The script automatically selects the last five posts to highlight on index.html.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no manual, no repository project, no way of sharing the solution (for now). That's by design. As I
(hopefully) write more often, more tools
and functionality will be needed.</p>
