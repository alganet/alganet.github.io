<h2>How Developers Stole "Dry Runs" From Machinists</h2>
<p class=info><em>Alexandre Gomes Gaigalas</em> – <em>December 22, 2025</em></p>
<p>If you’ve ever run a command with a <code>--dry-run</code> flag, you probably knew what it did. It ran the thing, but
not <em>the whole thing</em>.</p>
<p>More specifically, a dry run runs <strong>all but the irreversible parts</strong> of an operation.</p>
<h3>A Quick Example</h3>
<p>For example, let's say you have a command-line program called <code>cleanup-database</code>:</p>
<pre class=codeblock><code>$ <span class="code-statement">cleanup-database --help</span>
usage: cleanup-database [options]
Removes old data from the database.

Options:
--dry-run     Show what would be deleted, but don't actually delete anything
--force       Actually delete the data
</code></pre>
<p>When you run such program passing the <code>--dry-run</code> flag, it will show you what it would do without making
any changes:</p>
<pre class=codeblock><code>$ <span class="code-statement">cleanup-database --dry-run</span>
The following records would be deleted:
- Record ID 12345
- Record ID 67890
No changes have been made.
</code></pre>
<p>This is particularly useful for commands that perform destructive actions, such as deleting files or modifying
databases.</p>
<p>Dry runs are not limited to command-line tools. They can also be found in various programming libraries and
frameworks, where they allow developers to simulate operations without making permanent changes.</p>
<h3>But Why "Dry Run"?</h3>
<p>I mean, why not <code>--simulate</code> or <code>--preview</code>? Where does the term "dry run" even come from?</p>
<p><strong>It comes from the world of machining.</strong></p>
<p>First, let me show you what a "wet run" actually is:</p>
<figure><img src=/images/wet-run.jpg alt="A wet run of a machine">
<figcaption>A machine performing a "wet" run operation, with actual lubrication fluids being applied to the piece.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These operations are "wet" in the sense that a constant flow of lubrication fluid is needed to run the operation
smoothly.</p>
<p>When you are testing the motions without actually performing any change, there is no friction or heat, so the
lubrication fluid is not needed. This is a <strong>dry run</strong>, and that's where the term comes from.</p>
